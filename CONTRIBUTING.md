"Guidelines for contributing" 

# Contributing to the Project

We welcome contributions to the `git-homework` project!

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the project under your username, which you can freely modify.

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   After forking, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/git-homework.git
   cd git-homework
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**:  
   Create a new branch for your work. Never work directly on the `main` branch.

   ```
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**:  
   Once you're done, stage and commit your changes with a clear message.

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
   ```

5. **Push Your Changes**:  
   Push your changes to your forked repository.

   ```
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**:  
   Open a pull request from your forkâ€™s branch into the `main` branch of the original repository. Provide a clear description of the changes and the issue being resolved (if applicable).
